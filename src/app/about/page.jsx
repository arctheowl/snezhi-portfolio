                My career started with designing Commercial Interiors, working on a wide spectrum of pitches and international projects.
                Year 2020 brought a lot of challenges for the Commercial sector, so I chose to turn a difficult situation into an opportunity for growth and self-development, and focus on Residential Interiors.

                What I love the most about my job is connecting with people and delivering captivating designs that make the client feel heard. Whether the brief comes from a family, or a small/large organisation – listening and understanding are always the first steps I take, to deliver a space true to the client’s needs. I understand the importance of going that extra mile to ensure the customer experience is second to none.

                While my early background in Mathematics may sound dry at first, it inspired me to be open to novel solutions and made for an excellent foundation. I manage large projects systematically, while Technical drawings, Cost scheduling and Software learning are far from daunting.

                Idea exchange and collaboration are essential to every creative team – I am eager to bring a well-rounded point of view and a passion for thoughtful designs, full of individuality, to yours.
